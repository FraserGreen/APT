a) stops the linker? from reading the same declarations twice, if they are shared among different classses
b) otherwise they would be passed by value, which creates an infinite loop of copying.
c) both, as there are no pointers stored. if there were, it would be a shallow copy.
d) no, because the real life counterpart always already has the values upon drawing the card.
e) no, because the card is a model and should only ever deal with things that directly influence the card. printing etc. should be done elsewhere
